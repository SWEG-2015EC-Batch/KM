# Playing with Number'
Write a program that accepts an integer from the user and perform the following.<br />
Once you complete solving all the exercises compile it and prepare a menu.<br />
a. Prints the reverses of the number (e.g. input = 4637215 Output=5217364). <br />
b. Counts the number of digits in a given number (e.g. 23,498 has five digits) <br />
c. Find the sum of the digits of the a given number (e.g. input=4,823 sum=17) <br />
d. Find the product of even digits of the a given number (e.g. input=4,923 prod=8) <br />
e. Prints the first and the last digit of the number and find their sum. <br />
f. Swap the first and the last digit of the number. <br />
g. Check whether a number is palindrome or not. <br />
h. Find the frequency of each digit in a given integer and print in table format. <br />
i. Check if a number is Armstrong or not. <br />
[Hint]: A Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes
of its digits is equal to the number itself <br />
j. Check if a number is Strong or not. <br />
[Hint]: A Strong number is a number, where the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal
to the number itself. <br />
k. Check whether a number is Perfect number or not. <br />
[Hint]: A Perfect Number is an integer where the sum of its divisors minus the number
itself equals the number. <br />
